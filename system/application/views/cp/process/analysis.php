		<h1>Analysis</h1>
		<p>
		The final phase is an analysis of site performance as well as a retrospective look at the project to 
improve the process for future initiatives. During this phase we will review process efficiency, 
communications, response times, content provisions, quality, and overall effectiveness.	</p>

	<h3>The Main Components Of Analysis</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<a href="#" class="expand"><img src="/images/process/plus.png" /></a>
			<h3>Traffic Analysis</h3>
			<div><p><img src="/images/process/analytics1.jpg" /></p><p>After the project launches, we analyze how your audience is using the site. If this was a site redesign we look into how traffic has changed. We start with an overall view of traffic increase over a few months.</p>

			<h3>Site Usage Breakdown</h3>
			<div><p><img src="/images/process/analytics2.jpg" /></p><p>Once we have an overview of how your new site is affecting traffic, we dig deeper and and find out details about your visitors.  Which pages are being looked at more than others? Where are visitors coming from?  Are certain callouts on your pages being ignored? </p> </div>
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="#" class="expand"><img src="/images/process/plus.png" /></a>
			<h3>What improvements can be made?</h3>
			<div><p><img src="/images/process/analytics3.jpg" /></p><p>Once we have looked into how your site is being used in more detail we can fully access what needs to be improved on the site.  Do certain callouts need to be more noticeable?  Are visitors not following through with sales on certain products?  Have the expectations you had of the site in the beginning been met?</p> </div>

		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="#" class="expand"><img src="/images/process/plus.png" /></a>
			<h3>Project Review</h3>
			<div><p><img src="/images/process/analytics4.jpg" /></p><p>Beyond site traffic and analytics, internally we review how a project went throughout each step.  Although we are confident in our process and expect everything to go perfectly, we realize there is always room for improvement. What were the the major bugs during the production phase and how can they be planned for in future preproduction phases.</p> </div>

		<h2>Analytics Tools</h2>
		<p><img src="/images/process/analytics_tools.jpg" />There are various tools we can use to analyze your site traffic. Some clients may already have analytical tools in place which we can integrate into any new project. We recommend setting up Google Analytics for any new projects because of the flexibility it offers. Other analytics tools we may utilize are Facebook Insights, Click-Tracking, or Omniture depending on the needs of the project.  </p>
