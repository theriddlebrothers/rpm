		<h1>Preproduction</h1>
		<p>
		The most important phase of any project, Preproduction involves planning for what will need to be 
done, and how it will be achieved. During this phase we will meet with you to gain a better 
understanding of your requirements, and to help educate you of potential solutions to challenges that 
may be presented during the project. Throughout this stage we will build the necessary documentation 
for your site or application that can serve as a reference for employees, managers, investors and other 
vendors.		</p>

	<h3>The Main Components Of Preproduction</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<a href="#" class="expand"><img src="/images/process/plus.png" /></a>
			<h3>Project Overview</h3>
			<div><p><img src="/images/process/overview_screenshot.jpg" /></p><p>Before jumping into the details of a project with Requirements, IA, and wireframes it is important to get an overall picture of what the project entails. The Project Overview outlines an overall mission of the project and takes into consideration any top-level priorities for the rest of the pre-production phase. <br/><br/>Here we attempt to discover everything the client is looking for, and "why" from a top-level perspective. Does the client need e-commerce? Does the client need the site to be translated in different languages?  What is the client's audience?  These are the types of questions that will be asked at this stage.  These questions are meant to uncover technical as well as creative expectations. </p> </div>

			<h3>Requirements Gathering</h3>
			<div><p><img src="/images/process/requirements_screenshot.jpg" /></p><p>Requirements Gathering is perhaps the most important stage of Preproduction. Information gathered in this stage will further clarify the project overview and define the following IA and Wireframe stages as well. <br/><br/>

Requirements are an outline of everything a client needs and wants on a site, what a user is able to accomplish on every page and component, and defines the hosting environment for the project. A strong set of requirements helps with understanding the scope of the project and is important for estimating the time needed during the Production phase.<a href="#" class="article">view sample requirements doc</a></p>

			<h3>Information Architecture</h3>
			<div><p><img src="/images/process/IA_screenshot.jpg" /></p><p>Information Architecture takes all the information of a website and defines it in a coherent structure showing the hierarchy of pages.  The IA is not only important for creating the site navigational structure but also allows for discussion of site usability and gives an good overall picture of the scope of the site.<a href="http://www.theriddlebrothers.com/wp-content/uploads/sitemap.pdf" target="_blank" class="article">view sample information architecture</a></p> </div>
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="#" class="expand"><img src="/images/process/plus.png" /></a>
			<h3>Wireframes</h3>
			<div><p><img src="/images/process/preproduction_screenshot.png" /></p><p>Wireframes come before any design is started and show a basic site layout. It is important to remember that wireframes are not a design and are meant to show a basic visual layout of the site. Consider it a blueprint for the design. <br/><br/>

Wireframes allow one to Test and refine navigation, see how content lays out on a page, tighten up user interface design and determine web development and programming requirements. They are an important factor in creating a more efficient Production phase.</p> </div>

		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="#" class="expand"><img src="/images/process/plus.png" /></a>
			<h3>Project Schedule</h3>
			<div><p><img src="/images/process/project_schedule_screenshot.jpg" /></p><p>Before the Preproduction and Production phases we will provide a schedule outlining the various milestones to be completed. In the beginning of the project, prior to the Preproduction phase, the project schedule is an educated guess based on past projects of similar scope and size. After requirements have been collected and the Preproduction phase is wrapping up, a revised schedule will be provided outlining the Production phase in greater detail.</p> </div>

		</li>

	
	</ul>
	
	
		
	
	<div class="block">
		
		<p><img src="/images/process/livingdoc.png" /><h2>A Living Document</h2>All information gathered during the preproduction phase should be considered "A Living Document". This means that once preproduction is completed, these documents are expected to change. Although the preproduction phase is meant to cover all requirements of a project, in most cases, some requirements of a project are revealed during the production phase and it is necessary to go back and update the documents written in preproduction. This allows the project to grow while still maintaining strong roots. </p>
