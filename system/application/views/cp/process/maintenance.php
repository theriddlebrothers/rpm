		<h1>Maintenance</h1>
		<p>
		The Maintenance phase of our process includes training and/or additional updates that will be necessary for upkeep of the site. These updates may include design tweaks, minor development fixes, solution training, and other services.	</p>

	<h3>The Main Components Of Maintenance</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<a href="#" class="expand"><img src="/images/process/plus.png" /></a>
			<h3>Application Updates</h3>
			<div>
				<p><img src="/images/process/maintenance_updates.png" /></p>
				<p>After your site launches there is typically a list of "post-launch" items that are not critical for release, but would help improve overall user satisfaction. These may include content updates, minor alterations to the design, changing images or icons on the site, and other minor updates that do not fall into a separate release.</p>
			</div>
		</li>

			<a href="#" class="expand"><img src="/images/process/plus.png" /></a>
			<h3>Performance Monitoring</h3>
			<div>
				<p><img src="/images/process/maintenance_monitoring.png" /></p>
				<p>As your site popularity and customer base grows, various metrics must be monitored in order to ensure the system architecture is meeting the technical demands of your site. Long load times, general sluggishness or timeout errors could point to resource or architecture issues that could become costly if not resolved as soon as they are discovered. By monitoring your site we will be able to catch problems before they happen and prevent potential downtime.</p>
			</div>
		</li>

			<a href="#" class="expand"><img src="/images/process/plus.png" /></a>
			<h3>Ongoing Testing/Quality Assurance</h3>
			<div>
				<p><img src="/images/process/maintenance_testing.png" /></p>
				<p>More complex projects will require ongoing testing as site traffic increases and a more diverse set of users begin using the application. Additional testing is typically required in order to recreate obscure technical bugs, enhance usability, and continue to build on the foundation of the site.</p>
			</div>
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="#" class="expand"><img src="/images/process/plus.png" /></a>
			<h3>Training and Documentation</h3>
			<div>
				<p><img src="/images/process/maintenance_training.png" /></p>
				<p>Larger systems may require staff training and/or additional documentation on the various aspects of the system. This may include tutorials on using a content management system, help system documentation, technical specifications documents or other deliverables that will be used for various purposes. These sessions can range from in-person walkthroughs, screencasts, interactive microsites, or written documentation.</p>

			<h3>Consulting</h3>
			<div>
				<p><img src="/images/process/maintenance_consulting.png" /></p>
				<p>After your site has launched you may have additional questions outside of the scope of the initial project. This may include recommendations for future updates, assistance with integration of other products, or something entirely unrelated. Modern projects are no longer considered "complete", only ready for the next phase in a continual cycle. </p>
			</div>
		</li>
	
	</ul>
	
	
	<div class="block">
		<h2>We've Launched! Now What?</h2>
		<div>
			<p><img src="/images/process/maintenance_lifecycle.png" /></p>
			<p>Product development is a continual process, where each phase overlaps the next in a continual effort to create a better deliverable. The Maintenance phase provides for a transition between the initial release and future efforts for additional releases. It will outline how final changes or requests will be handled, the scope of new requests, and begin the collection of new ideas/features for the next release.</p>
